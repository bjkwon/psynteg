If tag contains variables that were defined lines above, then PrepareTags() crashes when returns the value.

for example,

rate=900, prd=1111.1

is fine, but 


rate=900, prd=1000000/rate

crashes.

SOLVED: Static EqSig.lib was not linked...the dll was unintentionally used and caused the problem.---setstr doesn't really help
